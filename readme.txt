Might and Magic IX - cshell.dll fix

This is fixed library for graphic problems with Nvidia card for Might and Magic IX: Writ of Fate

Use if you experience with very long delays when switching from 3d to 2d screens. (this problems occured on nvidia cards, there was no problem with ATI cards) 
1. overwrite MM9/DATA/cshell.dll with "cshell.dll" in MM9_cshell_fix.
