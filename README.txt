
Unit tests are build to validate positiva and negative test scenarios for Positive, Empty and Null values in the string.
So units tests are validating Longest and Shortest wordsin the given string

Assumptions:
1. Framework has Jnit and other libriaries 
2. String is given and not imputed 
3. If string is entered by the user , we can use scanner with String sentence = in.nextLine();
4. There are no additional scenarios to validate and just exploratory testing was applied
5. All words in the string are different length
